# Handwritten-digit-recognition

## Dataset  
The MNIST problem is a dataset developed by Yann LeCun evaluating machine learning models on the handwritten digit classification problem.
Images of digits were taken from a variety of scanned documents, normalized in size and centered.

Each image is a 28 by 28 pixel square (784 pixels total). Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.

**Train dataset contain 42000 Images,Test dataset contain 28000 Images**

 ## Steps
- Applied Principle Component Analysis and reducted the Dimensionality to 90 from 784
- Train the model on diffenent Machine Learning Algorithms using SciKit Learn's modules
- Compared the accuracy of SVM,KNN,Random Forest and Neural Networks


## Test Accuracy   
- Random Forest 0.93

- Support Vector Machine 0.91

- Nearest Neighbors 0.96

- Neural Network 0.97

## Final Results
Enhanced the real-time accuracy of Handwritten digits recognition using various ML modules embedded with Image Processing Techniques; obtained 97.7% accuracy on MNIST Dataset using 3 layered Neural Networks.
