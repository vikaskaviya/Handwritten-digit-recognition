# Handwritten-digit-recognition

## Dataset  
The MNIST problem is a dataset developed by Yann LeCun evaluating machine learning models on the handwritten digit classification problem.
Images of digits were taken from a variety of scanned documents, normalized in size and centered.
     
Each image is a 28 by 28 pixel square (784 pixels total). Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.

**Train dataset contain 42000 Images
**Test dataset contain 28000 Images








Enhanced the real-time accuracy of Handwritten digits recognition using various ML modules embedded with Image Processing Techniques; obtained 97.7% accuracy on MNIST Dataset using 3 layered Neural Networks.
